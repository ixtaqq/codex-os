Guidance for writing the skill itself (delete this section):

- Keep it short. Every line competes for context with the actual task.
- Match freedom to fragility: prose for judgment calls, exact commands for fragile sequences.
- Put long reference material in `references/` and load it only when needed; put runnable code in
  `scripts/`; put output templates in `assets/`.
- `name` must equal the folder name. Folder goes in `E:\Workspace\codex-os\skills\`, then run
  `scripts\sync.ps1`.
