GitHub Trending snapshot, captured 2026-08-10. Treat star gains as an attention signal, not validation of security, maintenance quality, or product fit.

## Cross-window signal

| Appeared in | Repositories | Reading |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Daily + weekly | [google/skills](https://github.com/google/skills), [ComfyUI](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI), [authentik](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik), [code-graph-rag](https://github.com/vitali87/code-graph-rag) | Skills, visual-model workflows, identity, and codebase context are sustaining attention rather than being a one-day spike. |
| Weekly + monthly | [reverse-skill](https://github.com/zhaoxuya520/reverse-skill), [TencentDB-Agent-Memory](https://github.com/TencentCloud/TencentDB-Agent-Memory), [AI-For-Beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/AI-For-Beginners), [book-to-skill](https://github.com/virgiliojr94/book-to-skill) | The agent ecosystem is moving from prompts toward reusable procedures, shared memory, and structured learning material. |
| Daily + monthly | [t3code](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code) | Coding-agent harnesses remain a live area, although this two-window overlap alone is weaker than the clusters above. |

## Most meaningful projects to watch

1. **Skills as a deployable interface.** [Google's skills repository](https://github.com/google/skills) appeared daily (+532) and weekly (+1,143). Its README describes a large, actively developed catalogue of Agent Skills for Google products and explicitly includes a Codex plugin installation route. This is the strongest institutional confirmation that skills are becoming a distribution format, not just a community convention.
2. **Durable, shared agent context.** [TencentDB-Agent-Memory](https://github.com/TencentCloud/TencentDB-Agent-Memory) gained +8,046 weekly and +10,732 monthly. Its stated model—governed chat memory, skills, LLM-wiki, and code graph assets—points to team-level context management as the next layer after single-agent prompting.
3. **Document ingestion as infrastructure.** [firecrawl/pdf-inspector](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector) led the weekly view (+8,846) with Rust tooling that detects scanned versus text PDFs and supports routing. This is practical plumbing for reliable document pipelines, not a new agent wrapper.
4. **Quality constraints around code generation.** [Nutlope/hallmark](https://github.com/Nutlope/hallmark) gained +19,221 monthly for an anti-generic-design skill, while [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) gained +49,928 monthly and [archify](https://github.com/tt-a1i/archify) +7,532. Interest is shifting toward giving agents disciplined specialist workflows and verifiable artifacts, not merely more autonomy.
5. **Agent operations and interfaces.** [orca](https://github.com/stablyai/orca) (+26,442 monthly), [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) (+17,222), [livekit/agents](https://github.com/livekit/agents) (+1,170 weekly), and [OfficeCLI](https://github.com/iOfficeAI/OfficeCLI) (+15,700 monthly) show demand for agent harnesses, parallelism, voice, and reliable interaction with existing office files.

## Window highlights

- **Daily:** [prime-agent](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-agent) led (+2,319), followed by agent-skill projects such as [agency-agents](https://github.com/msitarzewski/agency-agents) (+932) and [agent-skills](https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills) (+670). The daily page is especially susceptible to launches and social amplification.
- **Weekly:** PDF ingestion, security-tool routing, agent memory, an always-on coding agent, and education topped the list. The weekly results are the best compromise between novelty and persistence.
- **Monthly:** The list is dominated by agent products, skills, and agent-facing utilities, but includes useful adjacent signals: the real-time intelligence dashboard [worldmonitor](https://github.com/koala73/worldmonitor), local speech agents from [Hugging Face](https://github.com/huggingface/speech-to-speech), and open-source SEO/video tooling.

## Interpretation and caution

The durable signal is **operationalization of agents**: packaged expertise (skills), persistent/shared context (memory and code graphs), tool access (PDF/Office/voice), and coordination (parallel-agent harnesses). This aligns with the local Codex OS setup: maintain a curated, explicit skill set and invoke specialist workflows deliberately.

Do not infer that every fast-growing skill pack is safe to install. In particular, security or reverse-engineering packs such as [reverse-skill](https://github.com/zhaoxuya520/reverse-skill) should be code-reviewed and installed only with a clear authorized-use case. Trending ranks attention; it does not audit provenance, licensing, or supply-chain risk.

**Why:** Preserves a dated market scan and the decision-relevant takeaway: favor tools with clear operational value and review viral agent packages before enabling them.
**Applies to:** Codex OS skill curation and project tooling choices.
