description: PowerShell scripts invoked from inside a Codex sandbox must use the call operator and avoid .NET type literals

Codex executes sandboxed shell commands through a nested `powershell -Command "..."` whose outer
shell is in **ConstrainedLanguage** mode. Two consequences for any `.ps1` a loop or agent calls:

1. Invoke with the call operator — `& 'C:\path\script.ps1'`. Using `-File` across the language-mode
   boundary fails with *"Cannot dot-source this command because it was defined in a different
   language mode."*
2. The script itself must avoid .NET type literals and method calls (`[System.IO.Directory]::…`,
   `[IO.FileAttributes]`) and must not dot-source helper scripts. Cmdlets, `[pscustomobject]`,
   string methods, and property access are all fine.

**Why:** hit while smoke-testing the `repo-health` loop — the loop reported `blocked` twice before
the cause was clear. `scripts/doctor.ps1` was rewritten standalone to satisfy both rules and is the
working reference; `sync.ps1` and `loop.ps1` still dot-source `_common.ps1` because they only ever
run from a normal shell.

**Applies to:** any codex-os script meant to be called from inside a loop or agent session.
