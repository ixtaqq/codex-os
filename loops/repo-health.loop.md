Check the health of this codex-os installation.

Run exactly this, using the call operator (`-File` fails here: the sandbox shell runs in
ConstrainedLanguage mode, and `-File` across a language-mode boundary is treated as dot-sourcing):

    & 'E:\Workspace\codex-os\scripts\doctor.ps1'

Read the table it prints. If every row is OK or WARN and the exit code is 0, the loop is done —
report the row count and any WARN rows in your summary.

If any row is MISSING, DRIFT, CONFLICT, ORPHAN, or FAIL, this pass should diagnose exactly one of
them: name the row, explain the cause, and put the specific fix in `next_action`. Do not apply the
fix — this loop runs read-only, and repairs that touch `~/.codex` are the user's call.
