name: loop-runner
description: Run a task as an iterative loop that repeats until an explicit exit condition is met. Use when the work needs repeated passes rather than one shot — polling a build or deploy, grinding a test suite to green, sweeping a codebase file by file, monitoring something on an interval, or any request phrased as "keep going until", "every N minutes", "repeat until it passes". Also use when the user asks to schedule or inspect a headless loop defined in codex-os/loops/.

# Loop Runner

Two modes. Pick by whether the loop must survive outside this thread.

| Mode | Use when | Mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- |
| In-thread | The user is present and the work fits one session | The protocol below |
| Headless | It runs unattended, on an interval, or scheduled | `scripts/loop.ps1` |

OS root: `E:\Workspace\codex-os`.

## In-thread protocol

Before pass 1, state three things in one short block and get them right — a loop with a vague exit
condition burns tokens forever:

- **Goal** — what must be true at the end.
- **Exit condition** — the observable check that ends the loop. Must be verifiable by running
  something, not by feeling done.
- **Budget** — max passes, and what to do when it runs out.

Then each pass:

1. Do exactly one increment of work.
2. Run the check.
3. Emit one status line: `pass N/M — status=continue|done|blocked — <what changed> — <next action>`.

Stop rules, in order:

- `done` — the exit condition verifiably holds. Say so and stop.
- `blocked` — the same failure repeated twice with no new information, a missing credential, or a
  decision only the user can make. Stop and report what is needed. Do not keep retrying a command
  that failed the same way twice.
- Budget exhausted — stop, summarize progress, state what remains.

Never silently extend the budget. Never report `done` without having run the check.

## Headless loops

Loop definitions live in `loops/*.loop.md` — frontmatter config plus a prompt body. Format is
documented in `loops/_schema.md`.

Run one:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -File E:\Workspace\codex-os\scripts\loop.ps1 -Loop repo-health
```

Useful flags: `-MaxIterations <n>` to override the file and `-DryRun` to print the exact `codex exec`
commands without running them.

The runner drives `codex exec` with `--output-schema scripts/schemas/loop-status.schema.json`, so
every pass returns `{status, summary, next_action}` as JSON. The runner reads `status` and stops on
`done`, `blocked`, or `max_iterations`. Per-pass output lands in
`logs/<loop>/<run-timestamp>/iter-N.json`, with a human log alongside it. It records the session ID
emitted by the first pass and resumes that exact session; it never uses a global last-session selector.

To schedule a loop:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -File E:\Workspace\codex-os\scripts\schedule-loop.ps1 -Loop repo-health -Daily 09:00
```

`-List` shows registered loops, `-Remove <loop>` unregisters one.

## Writing a new loop

Copy an existing `.loop.md`, then check three things:

- `cwd` points at a directory that exists.
- `exit_when` is checkable by a command, and the prompt body says which command.
- `sandbox` is the least permission the work needs — `read-only` for monitors, `workspace-write`
  for anything that edits files. Never bypass approvals.

Keep the prompt body outcome-shaped: what should be true when it ends, what evidence proves it.

**Calling a `.ps1` from inside a loop:** use the call operator, not `-File`.

```powershell
& 'E:\Workspace\codex-os\scripts\doctor.ps1'
```

Codex runs sandboxed commands through a nested `powershell -Command`, and the outer shell is in
ConstrainedLanguage mode. `-File` across that boundary is treated as dot-sourcing and fails with
"Cannot dot-source this command because it was defined in a different language mode." Scripts a loop
calls must also avoid .NET type literals and method calls, which ConstrainedLanguage blocks —
`scripts/doctor.ps1` is written that way on purpose and is the working reference.
